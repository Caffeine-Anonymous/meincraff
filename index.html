TasteyServ is Creative Bukkit Minecraft server that has been hosting the 
same map file since September of 2011. 
Over the course of these four years, The map has grown tremendous in size. 
There are many areas to explore and to build with many different themes.

...and we're back!<br />
Sorry about the delay on bringing the server back online.
The issue was an OS based one, not a map based one, we didn't lose anything!
I've decided to make my life a bit more sane in the process, that dynmap
is switching to 4 pixels per block instead of 16. The visible difference is 
that individual blocks will be blurry, but the overall picture for 
surveyance purposes is identical. I've also decided to use SQLite as a tile
database instead of flatfile, so that should help a bit with backups, since
there's no longer millions of PNG files, but instead it's just one db.
I've taken this opportunity to add in another plugin for carts, which makes
it so chunks stay loaded where there are minecarts in it. This will come
in very handy in the future.

We had a bit of a technical glitch today when my IP changed. However, I used
the opportunity to upgrade our plugins! I've also made dynmap about 100% 
more useful with chat scrollback now. We've also added back in our Tzerbei
Map for a non-creative build on peaceful. The map follows the old generation
algorithmns from Beta 1.6. It's a very different game now!

Today, We introduced the new self hosted <a href="/wiki">Wiki</a>.
We also introduce this website, which is pretty cool.
Lastly, and, probably most important, we increased the server slots from 20 to
100 to signify that we're looking foward to bigger and better things.
Here's to another 5 years of TasteyServ!
